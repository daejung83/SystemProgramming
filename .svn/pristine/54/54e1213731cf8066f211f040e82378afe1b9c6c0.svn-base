int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	//Chapter 3
		//Program arguments argc argv
			//two ways to find the length of argv is to return the value of 
			//argc or loop around argv until hitting a NULL ptr

			//also argv[0] is the program it self

		//Environment Variables
			//ptrs to environment variables are stored in environ

		//String searching (Strings are just char arrays)
			//on a machine where pointers are 8 bytes
			//sizeof(ptr) would be 8 because that is the size of the pointer
			//sizeof(array) would be 6 where each char would be 1 byte with 0 at the end

		//Lifetime of automatic variables
			//Datastructure that is managing the lifetime of automatic variables are stack
